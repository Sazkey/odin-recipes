    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quick Omelet Recipe with rich flavour! Good for Breakfast</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tsp water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp minced chives</li>
      <li>1 ounce soft crumbled french cheese</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Whisk eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until yolks and
          whites are completely combined and eggs are light and frothy, about 30
          seconds.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs
          into skillet and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just
          starting to set. Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let cook
          until just slightly underdone and shiny. If necessary, move extra raw
          egg around to the edges of the skillet. Lower heat to medium-low to
          prevent browning, if necessary.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Sprinkle cheese down the middle of the omelet, along with 2 teaspoons
        chives. Fold one side over the cheese in the middle, followed by the
        other side, so the omelet is folded in thirds. Remove to a plate and
        sprinkle with remaining chives.
      </li>
    </ol>
